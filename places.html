	<h3>Mexico</p3>
	<p> I was originally born in Mexico, so I have luckily been able to visit many times. My family lives in Guanajuato so we normally go around that area. My favorite area is 
	Queretaro, I was born there and for a short time grew up there. I have been to Cancun once because it was a special occasion, but I hope to get to go again.The following are 
	pictures from some of my trips.</p>
